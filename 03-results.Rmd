# Results

Here is a graph showing my expected results.

This graph looks at the effect of wave break structures on the establishment of plants and the effect of two planting arrangements: clumped and dispersed.  The current literature on restoration techniques suggests a clumped planting method (where the plant plugs are planted close together, the plugs are all touching one another) is most successful at establishing in a high stress environment.

These data suggest that when coupled together, a wave break structure and clumped planting can increase establishment success of lacustrine wetland species.
