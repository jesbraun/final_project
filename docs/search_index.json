Restoration of wetlands is critical to recover lost ecosystem functions and services. Reestablishing native plant communities that contribute to ecosystem functioning is an important part of this process. Lacustrine wetlands, particularly those in the semi-arid Intermountain West region of the U.S., have experienced extensive hydrological alterations. They have sustained substantial water diversions and are commonly utilized as reservoirs, resulting in extreme changes in water levels that impact lakeshore vegetation. One highly altered system is Utah Lake, the location of my proposed research, in central Utah, USA. Utah Lake has vastly fluctuating water levels, and in some places, high wave energy and a large fetch. These dynamic wetland conditions challenge land managers aiming to reestablish lakeshore vegetation, particularly after removal of invasive vegetation. My research focuses on revegetation techniques. In this bookdown I suggest that by installing wave break structures on the shoreline of the lake to dissipate wave energy, and by planting in a clumped planting arrangement, you can increase the success and survival of your plant species. 2.1 This is what my code looked like First I loaded the packages tidyverse and patchwork and loaded my dataset. library(tidyverse) library(patchwork) x &lt;- read.csv(&quot;percent_survival.csv&quot;) I grouped by plant species, wave break, and planting arrangement. new_x &lt;- x %&gt;% group_by(plant_species, wave_break, planting_arrangment) %&gt;% mutate(mean = mean(percent_survival), lower = min(percent_survival), upper = max(percent_survival)) Then, I filtered the data down to one species, BOMA (Bolboschoenus maritimus) aka alkali bulrush. boma &lt;- new_x %&gt;% filter(plant_species == &quot;BOMA&quot;) p1 &lt;- ggplot(boma) + geom_pointrange(mapping=aes(x=planting_arrangment, y=mean, ymin=upper, ymax=lower, color= wave_break), size=1, fill=&quot;white&quot;, shape=22, position=position_dodge(.1)) + theme_bw()+ labs(x = &quot;Planting Arrangements&quot;, y = &quot;Mean Percent Survival&quot;)+ theme(legend.position = &quot;bottom&quot;)+ ggtitle(&quot;Bolboschoenus maritimus&quot;) I repeated the same code, but this time for DISP (Distichlis spicata) aka saltgrass disp &lt;- new_x %&gt;% filter(plant_species == &quot;DISP&quot;) p2 &lt;- ggplot(disp) + geom_pointrange(mapping=aes(x=planting_arrangment, y=mean, ymin=upper, ymax=lower, color= wave_break), size=1, fill=&quot;white&quot;, shape=22, position=position_dodge(.1)) + theme_bw()+ labs(x = &quot;Planting Arrangements&quot;, y = &quot;Mean Percent Survival&quot;)+ theme(legend.position = &quot;bottom&quot;)+ ggtitle(&quot;Distichlis spicata&quot;) Lastly, I linked everything together using the patchwork package. p1 + theme(plot.title = element_text(face = &quot;italic&quot;))+p2 + theme(plot.title = element_text(face = &quot;italic&quot;)) 2.1.1 This is my schema bold= primary key. Unique id for each record in that table Italics = foreign key, a variable shared between tables This schema applies to my broader research questions. For the purpose of this final, and my burgeoning coding skills, I have focused on one aspect of my research. "],["results.html", "Chapter 3 Results", " Chapter 3 Results Here is a graph showing my expected results. This graph looks at the effect of wave break structures on the establishment of plants and the effect of two planting arrangements: clumped and dispersed. The current literature on restoration techniques suggests a clumped planting method (where the plant plugs are planted close together, the plugs are all touching one another) is most successful at establishing in a high stress environment. These data suggest that when coupled together, a wave break structure and clumped planting can increase establishment success of lacustrine wetland species. "]]
